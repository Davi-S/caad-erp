# Examples

This directory collects short, task-focused walkthroughs for the command-line interface. Each markdown file mirrors a real workflow you can execute with the `caad-erp-cli` console script. If you prefer not to install the entry point, swap the command prefix for `python -m caad_erp.cli`.

Use these recipes to learn the happy paths, copy commands into your terminal, and adapt them to your own configuration file and workbook location. Commands show the `--config /path/to/config.ini` flag explicitly; omit it when your configuration file lives in the current directory. Replace placeholder tokens such as `<TRANSACTION_ID>` with the identifiers generated in your environment.
